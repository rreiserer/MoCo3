# MoCo3
Under Development

This code is intended to run a multi-microcontroller motor driver system

System uses three Atmega8 microcontrollers each controlling an A4979 stepper driver and an AS5341? magnetic encoder, an Atmel 32U4 acts as a coordination and communications controller, and an ESP-07S provides WiFi connectivity.
 Having 5 microcontrollers on board, this project is a tad bit complicated.
